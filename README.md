# HumanoidSim_Mathematica
Full-body Kinematics Model of a NAO Humanoid Robot Including CoM of each Chain
Here is a snapshot of the model:

This model receives joint angles as input and visualizes the whole robot, the CoM of each chain, the CoM of the robot, the projection of the CoM on the floor, and the support polygon of the robot on the floor.
I used this model to accomplish the whole-body imitation project.

Take a look at my papers:
[1: A simple and fast geometric kinematic solution for imitation of human arms by a NAO humanoid robot](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7886806/)
[2: Balance Strategy for Human Imitation by a NAO Humanoid Robot](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8466225)
